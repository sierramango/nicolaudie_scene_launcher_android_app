# nicolaudie_scene_launcher_android_app
Android app was created so that users could launch their scenes remotely over VPN. 

It can be downloaded from: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sierramango.nicolaudiescenelauncher&amp;hl=en_CA

At first, the app will ask for the IP address of the controller which will then be ping-ed. If successful, it will move to the control screen.
